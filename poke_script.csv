Hello there! Welcome to the world of POKEMON! My name is OAK! 
People call me the POKEMON PROF!

This world is inhabited by creatures called POKEMON! 
For some people, POKEMON are pets. Others use them for fights. 
Myself...I study POKEMON as a profession.

Here, *pc* There are 3 POKEMON here! Haha! They are inside the
POKE BALLS. When I was young, I was a serious POKEMON trainer.
