This is an ASCII Pokemon game. Move your character "@" around the map, accross different lands, and encounter and battle pokemon you find. Beware of the trainers indicated by letters.

Note that heap.c and heap.h were made by my professor. All other files were coded by me. 

Use "make poke" and then "./poke" in a linux enviroment to play

BUGS:
Sometimes when exiting a battle, map doesn't load. Press 't' the esc to fix
Recieving items and pokecenter not implemented
